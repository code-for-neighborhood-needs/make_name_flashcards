### Ideas for using the .tsv and image files:

The suggestions below are generated by ChatGPT:

Here’s how you can turn your “images-in-an images/ folder + CSV with `<img src="…">`” setup into live, shareable flashcards—with minimal re-hosting or manual uploads:

---

## 1. Anki (Desktop + AnkiWeb sync)

**Why?**
Anki is the gold-standard SRS flashcard app, and its desktop client lets you import a CSV **plus** all the media in one go.

**How:**

1. **Prepare your files**

   * Put your `cards.csv` (tab- or comma-separated) next to an `images/` directory containing exactly the PNGs you reference.
2. **Import into Anki desktop**

   * File → Import → select your CSV.
   * In the dialog, map “Front” and “Back” fields, check “Allow HTML in fields,” and point “Media folder” to the folder containing your `images/`.
3. **Review & Sync**

   * Once cards look right on desktop, click Sync to upload both cards and media to your AnkiWeb account.
   * Now you can study on any device running AnkiMobile or AnkiWeb.

## 2. RemNote (Web + Desktop App)

**Why?**
RemNote supports simple CSV imports with HTML image tags and will automatically upload any images you include.

**How:**

1. **Zip and upload**

   * Create a ZIP containing your CSV and the `images/` folder.
2. **Import**

   * In RemNote, go to “Import” → “Flashcards” → upload the ZIP.
   * Choose the field separator (tab/comma) and confirm “Import HTML” so it picks up your `<img>` tags.
3. **Tag & Organize**

   * RemNote will generate a new document with each row as a flashcard; images will appear inline.

## 3. Quizlet (Web)

**Why?**
Quizlet’s “Import from file” feature can take term-URL pairs—so if you host your images somewhere public, you can bulk-import.

**How:**

1. **Host your images**

   * Upload your entire `images/` folder to a free host (e.g. Imgur album, GitHub Pages, or Google Drive public folder).
2. **Convert CSV to two-column**

   * Column A: Front term (e.g. “Britlin”)
   * Column B: Full URL to image (e.g. `https://…/001_1.png`) plus comma plus back text:

     ```
     https://…/001_1.png,Alius, Britlin
     ```
3. **Import**

   * In Quizlet: Create set → Import from Word, Excel, Google Docs → paste your two-column data → Finish.
   * Quizlet will render the image on the back and the text afterwards.

---

## 4. Cram, Brainscape, Chegg Prep

All three let you bulk-import via CSV with an “Image URL” column:

* **Cram.com**

  * CSV columns: Term, Definition, Image URL
  * Upload images somewhere public, point your URLs there in the CSV, then use Cram’s “Import” tool.
* **Brainscape**

  * Similar CSV approach; their bulk importer will fetch your images and attach them.
* **Chegg Prep**

  * Under “Create flashcards,” choose “Import,” map columns (including Image URL), and upload.

## 5. Build a Simple Static Site (Self-Hosted)

If you prefer fully offline or on your own server, you can use a tiny JavaScript library:

1. **flashcards.csv** + **images/** folder in same directory.
2. Use a script like [jQuery-CSV](https://github.com/evanplaice/jquery-csv) + a minimal Flashcard UI (e.g. [Flashcard.js](https://github.com/jimpick/flashcard)) to:

   ```html
   <script src="jquery.js"></script>
   <script src="jquery.csv.js"></script>
   <script src="flashcard.js"></script>
   <script>
     $.get('flashcards.csv', csv => {
       let data = $.csv.toObjects(csv);
       Flashcard.init(data, {
         frontField: 'Front',
         backHTMLField: 'Back'
       });
     });
   </script>
   ```
3. Open the HTML file in any browser—no uploads required.
